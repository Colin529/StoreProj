# StoreProj
This is Taran and Colin's CompSci 222 final project.

Welcome to the Crow's Nest Clothing store! We sell a variety of clothes, and this back-end software can allow users to do various functions.
If you're just browsing, you can look at the whole storefront, filter products, and even sort them by various criteria.
If you log in or create an account, you can buy products, reserve products, and even create a shopping cart that will be retained throughout program resets!
If you have admin privileges, you can even add new products or edit product fields. ~~There's rumors of a secret *super-admin* clearance, but...perhaps it's just a rumor...~~
Once you're finished, you can quit the program from the main menu, and the list of users and list of products will be saved for future use.
We sincerely hope you enjoy using the Crow's Nest Clothing store!  ~Karasu (Taran) & Colin
